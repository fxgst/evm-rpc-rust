# Vite + React + Rust + EVM RPC

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, a backend written in Rust, and the EVM RPC canister to directly connect to Ethereum or other EVM-based blockchains.

## Get started with one click:
### In your browser:

In Gitpod 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fxgst/evm-rpc-rust/)

or GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/fxgst/evm-rpc-rust/?quickstart=1)


### Locally:

Make sure you have you have Docker and VS Code installed and running, then click the button below

[![Open locally in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/fxgst/evm-rpc-rust)

### Or do the manual setup:

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 21` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.18` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fxgst/evm-rpc-rust.git # Download this starter project
cd evm-rpc-rust # Navigate to the project directory
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm install # Install project dependencies
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
```

## üöÄ Develop

The frontend will update automatically as you save changes. 
For the backend, run `dfx deploy backend` to redeploy.
To redeploy all canisters (front- and backend), run `dfx deploy`.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- If the links printed by dfx do not work in Codespaces, run `./canister_urls.py` and click the links shown there.
- If you get an error `The wasm of 7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai in pulled cache ...` run `rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity/pulled/7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai`
- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
